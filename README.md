# Hospital-Readmission-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
A project focused on predicting the likelihood of hospital readmission for patients using structured healthcare data. The goal is to identify high-risk patients early, enabling better post-discharge planning and reduced healthcare costs.
Key Objectives

Analyze patient demographics, clinical history, and treatment patterns

Build a machine learning model to predict readmission risk

Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

Visualize insights to support interpretability

Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Workflow

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model training and validation

Performance evaluation and visualization

Results

Successfully trained a predictive model for readmission risk

Achieved reliable classification performance using standard metrics

Visualized key trends influencing readmissions

Note

This project is an independent implementation inspired by real-world healthcare prediction problems. All data used is anonymized/synthetic and intended for educational purposes only.
